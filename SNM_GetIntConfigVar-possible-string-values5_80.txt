# The following 411 variable-names can be used for the SWS-functions 
#
#    SNM_GetIntConfigVar(), SNM_SetIntConfigVar(), SNM_GetDoubleConfigVar() and SNM_SetDoubleConfigVar()
#
# who change Reaper's configuration-variables at run time. Just pass the variable-name to the parameter "varname".
#
# These variablenames are from Reaper 5.80 and probably missing some, but should be fairly complete anyway.
#
# These can be used to set configuration-stuff in the preferences, the project-settings, the render-dialog,
# many context-menus(like MCP or transport-context-menus) and various others.
# They are either double or integer-values. The integer-values are usually bitfields, where every bit stores 
# e.g. the value of a checkbox in the preferences.
# That said: one variable may contain the settings for up to 32(more?) settings at once.
#
# Sometimes, variables seem not be existing and valid until they've been set somehow. For instance, afxcfg appears
# only as valid, when an audio-format for "Apply FX, Glue, Freeze, etc" in the Project Settings -> Media-dialog has 
# been set.
# So if you discover a variable as not functioning, keep in mind it might not be set(yet) and therefore not available.
#
# I also document limitations with variables within this textfile. These are not taken from setting these variables, 
# but rather taken from the limitations imposed by setting-dialogs. So, even if I write about limitations, other values
# may be possible as well, though I would say, this could lead to unpredictable behavior of Reaper.
# It is unclear, if the SWS-functions (or the underlying C++ function get_config_var) are checking for valid values to
# reject them, if invalid(and prevent possible crashes, etc). 
# So, be better on the safe side and stay within the boundaries I document.
#
# Keep in mind: if you change settings, these changes might not be stored in Reaper's setting-files, so they 
#               may get lost, when Reaper is exited. If you want to retain settings, you need to set them in
#               the corresponding ini-files as well(usually the reaper.ini) with BR_Win32_WritePrivateProfileString()
#
#               Project-settings should be stored the next time a project is saved, but doublecheck that, if 
#               storing projectsettings into a projectfile is a must in your script!
